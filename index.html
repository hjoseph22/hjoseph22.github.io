            <h1>Happy 21st Birthday Debby!</h1>
            <p>
        Today is a truly special day because it's your birthday. I'm blessed beyond words to call you my best friend. You have transformed my life effortlessly, and I am deeply thankful to have found you when I needed you the most. I prayed for someone like you to enter my life, and incredibly, my prayers were answered with more than I could have hoped for. God blessed me with an extraordinary friend—a beautiful, pure-hearted, generous, brilliant soul. You stand out among the billions, and I could spend pages extolling your virtues, but even that would not be enough to capture all that you are.
            </p>

         So many people are uncertain about the future when they first meet someone. However, Debby, from the moment I first saw you, I already found myself imagining a future together. That puzzled, slightly misanthropic look on your face was all it took for me to know you were going to be the love of my life—and you are. Are you impressed that I used a big word? I looked it up just for you, bae.
                </p>
                <p>
        From the very moment you entered my life, everything seemed to fall magically into place. It was as though we had been friends in a past life, easily picking up where we left off. We often joked about finding the male versions of ourselves in each other, but deep down, I've realized something profound—I could search the whole world over and never find another soul like yours. And honestly, I wouldn't want to. You are incomparably unique, a rare gem that I had the fortune to stumble upon.

        Your presence is like a shooting star—brilliant, breathtaking, and exceedingly rare. Each appearance in the sky is unique, and so are you in the vast expanse of the universe. Your uniqueness isn’t just in being different, but in being irreplaceably you, impacting my life in ways no one else could.
                </p>
                <p>
        I am convinced that no matter the circumstances—whether cast in utter darkness, silenced by distance, or separated by time—I would recognize you. Even if we were rendered mute and deaf, unable to communicate as we do now, there's a deeper connection that would guide me to you. It's as if our souls are tethered across lifetimes, recognizing each other through different bodies, different eras, and different challenges.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
        In every scenario imaginable, I would find you and love you. My affection for you is not bound by the physical world or the limitations of our current existence. It transcends time, space, and reality. I love you in a way that is profound and unending, as constant as the stars in the night sky. And just as the universe expands endlessly, so does my love for you, growing and deepening with each passing moment.
                </p>
                <p>
        As we continue our journey of life together, know that you are cherished not just for what you bring to my life but for everything that you are. I look forward to more laughter, more conversations, and more shared moments—each one a precious memory etched into my heart. Here’s to us, to our incredible friendship, and to a future filled with as many blessings as the stars above.

        I love you, Debby, beyond words and beyond this lifetime. I promise to cherish and honor this bond we share, forever and always. And may your 21 and many more years to come be filled with blessings in Jesus' name, Amen.
